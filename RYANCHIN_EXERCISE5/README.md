# Exercise_5


Finish transitioning the [previous script](https://github.com/IDMNYU/DM-UY1133-B_CreativeCodingFA15/tree/master/week_7_Thurs) 
where we created different functions, to methods for the class. Then, by passing different parameters to the class constuctor and the methods, make each object/instance of the object, be unique from the others.

Use the code here.

STUDY the chapters in the text book!

Make at least 5 different monsters.

Take it further: use an array to store them, get some of them to move on input, etc.


THEN:
Take one of your former sketches (Exercise 1 is a good one) and translate it into classes. Make multiple and different monsters. Add functionality to them (and your code!)
